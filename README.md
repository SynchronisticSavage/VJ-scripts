Depends
well it depends on the script :P
Many of the scripts will work in ubuntu 12.04 and 14.04 with some 12.04 scripts using gst-0.10 and 14.04 scripts using gst-1.0 but not always :P
have not tested but should work with 16.04 aswell...

a full install of gstreamer good bad ugly tools gl etc is essential (from bin is fine...except the gl you may have to compile)

v4l2loopback + yuv4mpeg_to_v4l2: from git https://github.com/umlaeute/v4l2loopback (compile examples and copy to /usr/bin)

veejay+reloaded: http://veejayhq.net/  -  an awesome veejay program 

effectv: http://effectv.sourceforge.net/ an old but awesome and powerful video effects program...its fun to hit up and down to the beat, and change through a ton of awesome video effects...uses the old version of v4l amd v4loopback...


dir:
    gst
the gst dir contains a collection of gstreamer gst-launch scripts useful for piping video around, even grabbing videos from youtube 

the scripts are named based on their gstreamer pipe flow
